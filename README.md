# KNN Implementation with KD-Tree

This project contains a custom implementation of the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm using a **KD-Tree** for faster neighbor searches.  
It supports both **classification** and **regression** tasks with different distance metrics.

---

## Features
-  Supports **classification** and **regression**
-  Built from scratch (no scikit-learn KNN)
-  Multiple distance metrics:
  - Euclidean
  - Manhattan
  - Minkowski (custom `p` value)
-  Weighted and unweighted predictions
-  Uses **KD-Tree** for efficient neighbor queries

---

## Installation
Clone the repository and navigate to the project folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/knn-kdtree.git
cd knn-kdtree
